<h2 class="entry-title">ABOUT THE DIRECTOR</h2>
<div class="entry-content">
<p><b>INTERVIEW WITH KOJI WAKAMATSU</b></p>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><img hspace="10" alt="Photography by Osamu Nagasawa" align="left" src="http://www.united-red-army.com/files/Wakamatsu-small.jpg" />&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><strong>Young yakuza Koji Wakamatsu was sent to prison in his twenties; there, he learned that power leads to repression and brutality. After his release, he wrote a book about his experience and found in filmmaking a way to expose the abuse of power. In 1959, he worked for television and, four years later, shot his first films. He was granted total artistic freedom, as long as sex and violence predominated. His &ldquo;pinku eiga&rdquo; (erotic Japanese films) attracted a lot of attention and, step by step, he realized that eroticism was necessary to the development of his political discourse; thus, the original constraint had become a necessity. In 1965, he created his own production company, Wakamatsu Production, and directed </strong><em><b>Secrets behind the Wall</b></em><strong>. The film was submitted to Berlin Film Festival that same year and was nominated for the Golden Bear. It caused general indignation and a diplomatic incident between Germany and Japan; Wakamatsu&rsquo;s camera had thus become an active political weapon exposing the faults of a hypocritical government and the mouthpiece of the identity crisis of young people. Wakamatsu&rsquo;s films, shot frenetically (around ten films a year), with a simplistic touch in their bare staging that reminds Jean-Luc Godard, but with sexual excesses and brutality that are typical of exploitation films, are virulent anarchist manifestos that are still maddening Japanese authorities.</strong></div>
<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>What was the inspiration behind the <i>United Red Army</i>?<br />
</b>There were three fascist countries: Japan, Germany and Italy. For one reason or another, after the war, in these fascist countries, young people came together under a shared ideology, communism and the Red Army. Of course there were differences. In Germany and Italy, the people fought against the established power, whereas in Japan they killed each other and for me, this is a painful difference.</div>
<div>I wanted to examine the reasons that led talented young people with promising futures to take a stand. I wanted to show what they rose up against and why they fought. I wanted to put these questions into a film, show why they all headed into the mountains and why it turned into a disaster.</div>
<div>Even if it seems a little over the top, I wanted to make this film for future generations. In Japan, there are so many films on the Asama affair, so many confused, fantasized, or misleading films that I wanted to reinstate the truth and hand it down to future generations. I feel it is my mission as a filmmaker. The trigger was the film adapted from the memoires of a Sasa police officer, <i>The Choice of</i> <i>Hercules</i>. When I saw it, I knew I had to make a film on the subject to finally tell the truth. And I felt that the young people murdered or killed during the events were telling me to say what really happened. They gave me the courage. In reality, a lot of history has flowed from the perspective of this police officer who described how the police caught the bad guys. At the time, the siege was broadcast live by Japanese television around the country as a way of killing the movement. It was a strategy to show that youth was bad and to say to them: if you join these movements, you will be up against the power of the State and you will turn into bad guys.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Was it your intention, from the outset, to make a film that was half-fiction, half-documentary? Which part is fictional?<br />
</b>There are the archives of newspapers from the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s. I wanted to include these images because I believe you can&rsquo;t understand the context of the Asama events without them. You have to include these documents to understand how some Japanese people rose up against the established power. Afterwards, of course, I had to imagine part of it in fictional terms because the period is no longer the same and the landscape has changed. I did a lot of research and during this research, I realized I needed fictional elements to represent certain situations because otherwise, I couldn&rsquo;t talk about them. I wanted to be very honest. That is why the caption at the start of the film specifies that this is about real events with a few fictional additions.</div>
<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>So fiction serves to fill in the blanks of things we can&rsquo;t know?<br />
</b>Of course there are actors acting so it can&rsquo;t be a documentary. It appeals to the emotions. I talked to Kunio Bando who lived through the Asama events at the time. I asked him what happened. What you see in my film was described to me by real protagonists. All the events are based on facts. But there are no documents attesting what happened there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Doesn&rsquo;t the documentary part also appeal to the emotions? There is a huge amount of information and different documents in an hour. Did you want something this oppressive in the documentary part? <br />
</b>These facts are necessary to understanding.</div>
<div>I wanted to start the film with the death of young Michiko Kanba in front of the Diet during the riot against the Japan-US Security Treaty in 1960. The Vietnam War had broken out. Malcom X had been assassinated. The Cultural Revolution was underway in China, and in France May 1968 was in full swing. The world was in turmoil. In Japan, there were student movements opposed to the rise in the cost of higher education, the financial scandal at Nichidai University, the peasant revolt in a Sanrizuka against the construction of Narita airport, demonstrations for the retrocession of Okinawa and against the Vietnam War. If we don&rsquo;t correctly describe the context of the era, we can&rsquo;t understand why the United Red Army was created. I wanted to describe this and analyze this period.</div>
<div>In Japan today, some people do not know what happened. They do not even know that Japan fought against the United States. There is a cruel lack of understanding and knowledge of history and I wanted to ensure that these events would be told. I wanted to ensure that these young people who marched in the streets to shout out for change, and were even arrested by the police, would be heard. During the Vietnam War, a lot of arms transited through Japan. It was a transit base for arms that were then sent to Vietnam. The people were very angry that the Japanese government agreed to carry out whatever America dictated. This is why there were riots at Shinjuku station (where the arms headed for American bases transited). It had a huge impact on youth.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>How did you experience the events at the time?</b></div>
<div>I believe in these young people. Of course I too criticized student intellectuals who had never worked and who shouted, &ldquo;Worker comrades!&rdquo; and spouted complicated theories. I said to them, &ldquo;Say things that are easier to understand!&rdquo;</div>
<div>But honestly, aren&rsquo;t young people the only ones who can rise up to change the world?</div>
<div>It is thanks to their struggle that the system of military conscription does not exist in Japan and I can keep making the films I want without censorship.</div>
<div>When the shoot-out at the Asama Mountain Lodge happened, I was on their side, against the authorities. When they then announced that there had been a purge among members of the United Red Army, it was a shock.</div>
<div>At that time, Masao Adachi* and myself had just made <i>Red Army - FPLP: Declaration of World War</i> and I heard that Mieko Toyama, who helped us find theaters for the film, was also killed. I was crazy with anger but I couldn&rsquo;t do anything. I said to myself I would never forgive them.</div>
<div>Later, I calmed down and thought it through. How did it come to this? If things turned out that way, if students with career paths all laid out for them had come to the conclusion that society had to change, there was a reason.</div>
<div>So I tried to understand. In any case, I refused to hide behind easy commentaries such as, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s wrong&rdquo; as soon as information was broadcast.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>You give the impression that, deep down, you want to approve of them.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>Whether or not it is right or wrong to approve of them is not the issue. The main thing is to understand their driving force. Today, a lot of people think they were stupid. But I say that people who are simplistic enough to call young people - who have turned their backs on a comfortable life and themselves to fight - stupid, are really the stupid ones.</div>
<div>Some people ask me what the point is of making a film today about the United Red Army. I would like to ask them in response whether the situation has changed at all. Have any problems been solved since then? There are still wars going on in the world, the Security Treaty with the US still exists and authorities monitor citizens even more strictly. At universities, you can&rsquo;t even carry a banner in peace. Nothing has changed.</div>
<div>If war broke out, our opponents and we would kill and be killed. The stupid thing is that we have become indifferent to this reality.</div>
<div>We are stupid enough to be prepared to change the constitution so it allows us to make war.</div>
<div>I wouldn&rsquo;t say these young people were right. But I think the atrocities they were responsible for reflect a certain society. It is easier for those who have never fought to criticize.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>During the shooting, it is said you were leading the way, heading into the wind, always strong in the face of adversity. If you hadn&rsquo;t shown the example, neither the cast nor crew would have shown such abnegation. </b></div>
<div>Every morning, I was the first to get up and I worked on the scenes I would shoot that day. I never prepare a storyboard. All the cutting is in my head. Every morning, I went over things before going on the set. I work that way so I don&rsquo;t get lost during the real shoot. I don&rsquo;t have time to get lost. If I do, shooting stops. But I think this film was shot by all of us together, including the assistant directors. If any one person had been missing, we couldn&rsquo;t have made the film. That&rsquo;s what I told my crew at the end of filming. That&rsquo;s why I kept saying during shooting, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get caught up in routine. Stop pretending you know everything! Forget everything you&rsquo;ve learned before!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why nobody had a regular job on the shoot. Everyone did what they were capable of. The cameramen drove the cars themselves. The lighting crew went all the way to Shizuoka to rent a cheaper truck. Everyone understood the budget was limited and they really went to great lengths. There were no costume designers, no make up artists (except to simulate wounds) and I didn&rsquo;t let agents on the set. The actors had to be responsible for their costumes and accessories. If you just put on the clothes that have been laid out for you and turn up for make up, you can&rsquo;t get a real result. I only took actors who agreed to work in these conditions and wanted to do the film.</div>
<div>On an ordinary shoot, there is the shooting team and the production team. Everyone only does what is in his job description. They work like bureaucrats. But this time, I decided to do away with this practice. Sometimes, I even asked actors to think about how to shoot the scene on the set. Anyone can act, and if I can direct, then anyone can do it. You just have to want it.</div>
<div>Yet there are too many films made without any real desire these days.</div>
<div>The Ministry of Culture has to give money to these kinds of films. They never give any to me! [laughter] For this film, I asked for a grant but my request was dismissed. I had prepared a ton of papers for the grant application and they rejected it on a sheet of paper. So I mortgaged my house and the movie theater I own and I still think I&rsquo;m heading for bankruptcy! [laughter] This Ministry really undermines Japanese culture. I want to say it out loud. Because we need money to make films, we often end up shooting films that flatter the Ministry of Culture. Anyway, for a film that was dismissed by the Ministry, I still won a prize at the Tokyo Film Festival!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>In your look at the young people in the Red Army, is there perhaps also some compassion? </b></div>
<div>They were prepared to die. When I wondered how I should represent Mori&rsquo;s death, I found a farewell letter that he had written to his brothers in arms just before he died and I thought I had to use it. Even though Mori had done dreadful things, he did his self-criticism and wrote that he would die alone. Maybe I wanted to end the film by showing viewers a ray of hope.</div>
<div>If I hadn&rsquo;t had affection for these young people, I certainly couldn&rsquo;t have described them like this. Isn&rsquo;t there somewhere some goodness in all human beings? The criminal is simply someone who can&rsquo;t control the dark side that we all have inside us. Look at me, for example, if I had not become a filmmaker, maybe I would have taken a darker path and become a criminal.</div>
<div>By the way Mori dies, I wanted to bring the human being back to life. I wanted those who thought they could not forgive him to see it and realize that what created a being that had no other choice than to kill himself was the United Red Army, it was the RAF, which is itself a product of post-war Japan, that by spilling blood during the Korean war was able to fix its economy.</div>
<div>Why were these young people pushed that far? Guys who don&rsquo;t understand that some people are ready to die when they enjoy a comfortable situation, without ever having to fight for it, have no right to judge them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>How do you feel now that the film is finished?</b></div>
<div>This film was a challenge and I threw myself into producing it. But I had doubts. I said to myself, maybe no movie theaters would screen my film and if I put one foot wrong, the film would be lost. I was very anxious. Now I think if I hadn&rsquo;t made this film, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to die in peace. That&rsquo;s why I decided to produce it, saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do our best and go it alone.&rdquo; Now the film is finished and I see viewers shedding tears and I say to myself, the film has come a long way. The more it is seen, the bigger it will get.</div>
